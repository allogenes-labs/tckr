**Free crypto data in one pip install. No keys required to start.**

Building anything with crypto data usually means signing up for five APIs, writing the same retry loop five times, juggling rate limits, and watching it all break when one provider goes down. tckr collapses that into one Python package: 17 of the most-used sources work the moment you install it, and another 12 unlock with free signups. The same registry doubles as an agent toolkit for Claude, OpenAI, MCP, and LangChain — so if you're plugging crypto data into an LLM, it's one install away.

```bash
pip install tckr              # data layer
pip install tckr[agent-mcp]   # + universal MCP server for any LLM
pip install tckr[agent-all]   # + all four agent adapters
```

Then run `tckr status` to see your capability dashboard — every source colour-coded by what's usable **right now** (most are keyless), what a free key would **unlock**, and what an optional key would **expand**:

```bash
tckr status
```

```python
import asyncio
from tckr import quotes

async def main():
    print(await quotes.get(["BTC", "ETH", "SOL"]))
    # {'BTC': {'price': 77150.0, 'source': 'coingecko', ...},
    #  'ETH': {'price': 2890.4,  'source': 'coingecko', ...},
    #  'SOL': {'price': 178.2,   'source': 'coingecko', ...}}

asyncio.run(main())
```

No signup, no key, no rate-limit boilerplate. If CoinGecko 429s, the call quietly falls back to Hyperliquid.

## What's in the box

32 data sources, grouped by the corners of crypto people usually glue together by hand:

- **Prices & oracles** — CoinGecko, Hyperliquid, Pyth
- **DEX & on-chain** — GeckoTerminal, DexScreener, Alchemy (EVM), Helius (Solana)
- **Perps** — Hyperliquid, Coinalyze (cross-exchange funding, OI, liquidations)
- **Launchpads** — Pump.fun, Clanker, Virtuals
- **Token safety** — GoPlus, Honeypot, LP-lock detection
- **DeFi data** — DefiLlama (TVL, yields), Etherscan, The Graph
- **Social & prediction** — LunarCrush, Neynar (Farcaster), Polymarket
- **News & events** — CryptoNews (outlet RSS), GDELT (global events), Finnhub (tradfi)

17 sources are keyless. 12 more unlock with free signups. 3 paid keys add deeper coverage. Modules without their key gracefully no-op, so a partial install still works — and `tckr status` tells you what's live right now.

A second, fuller example:

```python
import asyncio
from tckr import quotes, geckoterminal, defillama

async def main():
    print(await quotes.get(["BTC", "ETH", "SOL", "HYPE"]))

    # Trending DEX pools on Base
    for p in await geckoterminal.trending_pools("base", limit=5):
        print(p["name"], p["price_usd"], p["volume_24h_usd"])

    # Base chain TVL + top protocols
    print(await defillama.chain("base"))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Wire it into agents

Spawn the universal MCP server from any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cline, Continue.dev, custom orchestrators):

```bash
pip install tckr[agent-mcp]
tckr-mcp        # listens on stdio
```

Or import the adapter for your platform:

```python
# Claude Agent SDK
from tckr.agent_toolkit.adapters.claude_sdk import build_crypto_mcp_server

# OpenAI / Anthropic function calling
from tckr.agent_toolkit.adapters.openai import get_openai_tools, get_anthropic_tools, execute_tool

# LangChain
from tckr.agent_toolkit.adapters.langchain import get_langchain_tools
```

All adapters serve the same 67 tools from one platform-neutral core. Each tool description auto-injects a tier tag (`[keyless]`, `[keyed-free: needs X]`, `[paid OK]`) from the capability registry, so the model knows what'll work before it tries. A `capabilities` introspection tool lets the agent self-discover the live state:

```python
import tckr
print(tckr.capabilities()["summary"])
# {'total': 32, 'configured': 17, 'by_tier': {'keyless-free': 17, 'keyed-free': 12, 'keyed-paid': 3}}
```

## Unlock more with free API keys

Free signups, no credit cards. Ranked by what we actually use in production:

| Key | What it unlocks | Sign up |
|---|---|---|
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | EVM wallet balances + LP-lock detection on Base / ETH (2 modules) | [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com) |
| `HELIUS_API_KEY` | Solana RPC + Jito MEV intel + wallet PnL (3 modules) | [helius.dev](https://helius.dev) |
| `COINALYZE_API_KEY` | Cross-exchange perps: funding spread, OI, liquidations (Binance / Bybit / OKX / HL) | [coinalyze.net](https://coinalyze.net) |
| `BIRDEYE_API_KEY` | Solana token analytics, top holders, contract security | [birdeye.so](https://birdeye.so) |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY` + `ALPACA_API_SECRET` | US equity/ETF option chains + greeks + IV (free `indicative` feed; no account funding needed) | [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets) |
| `MORALIS_API_KEY` *or* `BITQUERY_API_KEY` | Pump.fun discovery (new / about-to-bond / graduated). Either one alone is sufficient | [moralis.io](https://moralis.io) / [bitquery.io](https://bitquery.io) |
| `COINGECKO_DEMO_API_KEY` | Higher rate limit on the most-used price endpoint — free tier 429s under any real load | [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com) |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | ~70 EVM chains via the unified V2 API (one key covers ETH, Base, Arb, Op, Polygon, BNB, …) | [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) |
| `LUNARCRUSH_API_KEY` | Galaxy Score, AltRank, topic feeds, social sentiment | [lunarcrush.com](https://lunarcrush.com) |
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Tradfi + crypto market news (general/forex/crypto/merger) + per-ticker company news; ~60 req/min | [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io) |
| `THEGRAPH_API_KEY` | Higher-quota subgraph access (Uniswap, Aave, etc.) — public gateway works keyless but throttles fast | [thegraph.com](https://thegraph.com) |

**Tip:** Alchemy + Helius alone open up everything on-chain (EVM + Solana). Add Coinalyze if you care about perps; Birdeye if you focus on Solana memecoins.

## Paid keys for deeper work

These actually buy you something beyond rate-limit bumps:

| Key | What you get |
|---|---|
| `NEYNAR_API_KEY` | Farcaster cast search, channel feeds, trending fungibles — keyless tier only has user lookup |
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` (Pro) | 500+ req/min plus Pro-only endpoints (top movers, NFT, full historical OHLC) |
| `MESSARI_API_KEY` | Research-grade asset profiles + deep metrics — most useful endpoints moved paid in 2024 |
| `TOKENTERMINAL_API_KEY` | Protocol fundamentals: revenue, fees, P/E, treasury, full historical series |
| `SOLSCAN_API_KEY` (Pro) | Solana explorer data — the public no-key API was retired (2026-06), so a key is now required (free Pro tier available); unlocks richer parsing + higher limits |

All keys are optional. Modules without their key gracefully no-op (return `None` / `[]`); `tckr status` shows what's configured right now.

## Composition

Sources are designed to chain. A few examples:

- `pumpfun.live_trades(mint)` → `jito.snipe_score(sigs)` — how bot-sniped is this launch?
- `clanker.new_tokens()[i]["requestor_fid"]` → `neynar.user_popular_casts(fid)` — what's the deployer saying about their token?
- `clanker.new_tokens()[i]["pool_address"]` (V4 PoolId) → `lp_lock(pool_id)` — is the Clanker LP locked?
- `pumpfun.top_traders(mint)` → `wallet_pnl(wallet)` — is the top buyer actually profitable across their other trades?
- `gdelt.tone_timeline("federal reserve")` → `polymarket.top_volume()` — is global-press sentiment on the Fed turning ahead of the rate-decision market's odds?
- `news.latest("ethereum ETF")` → `quotes.get(["ETH"])` + `history.candles(["ETH"])` — pair the headline flow on a catalyst with live price + recent candles for an agent's event read.

## Fallback cascades: `tckr.quotes`, `tckr.history`, `tckr.news`

Real consumers usually want best-available data, not a specific provider. Three cascade modules wrap the common pattern so callers don't reimplement it:

```python
from tckr import quotes, history, news

# USD spot price, CoinGecko → Hyperliquid fallback
q = await quotes.get(["BTC", "ETH", "NEAR", "HYPE"])
# {'BTC': {'price': 77150.0, 'source': 'coingecko', ...}, 'HYPE': {'price': 63.6, 'source': 'hyperliquid', ...}}

# 30-day daily candles, CoinGecko market_chart → Hyperliquid candleSnapshot
h = await history.candles(["BTC", "HYPE"], days=30)

# Latest headlines merged across every available provider (keyless + keyed)
items = await news.latest("ethereum ETF", limit=20)
# [{'title': ..., 'url': ..., 'source': 'cointelegraph', 'provider': 'cryptonews', 'published_at': ...}, ...]
```

The quote/history results carry a `source` field so callers can detect when fallback ran; `news` items carry a `provider` field naming which source produced each one. The `news` cascade fans out across `cryptonews` (keyless crypto RSS), `gdelt` (keyless global events), and `finnhub` (when keyed), de-duplicates by URL, and sorts newest-first. All three cascades are exposed as agent tools (`quote`, `candles`, `news`).

Hyperliquid is the canonical free-tier fallback: keyless, no rate limit at typical reading volume, and covers ~230 majors + mid-caps — almost the entire CoinGecko "interesting" universe minus long-tail alts (which belong in DEX pool contexts anyway).

## Diagnostics: `tckr.health()` and `tckr update`

Every HTTP call updates a per-provider rolling summary. Read it to see which sources are currently rate-limited or down:

```python
import tckr
print(tckr.health())
# {"coingecko":  {"ok_count": 14, "fail_count": 3, "last_status": 429, "last_429_ts": "..."},
#  "hyperliquid": {"ok_count": 22, "fail_count": 0, "last_status": 200, ...}}
```

Exposed as an agent tool too (`health`) — useful when an agent is reasoning about why data looks thin.

The CLI checks PyPI for new releases once a day and shows an upgrade banner in `tckr status`. To install:

```bash
tckr update              # one-step upgrade
tckr update --check      # dry-run; just report if a new version exists
```

Detects pipx / `uv tool` / PEP 668 system-managed installs and suggests the right command instead of failing. Set `TCKR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to silence the implicit banner.

## Configuration

All API keys are optional. Set them as env vars (or via a `.env` file picked up by your shell); `tckr status` shows what's configured right now. Cache TTLs and HTTP behavior (timeouts, retries) are tunable via `TCKR_*` env vars — see [`tckr/settings.py`](tckr/settings.py).

## Agent toolkit adapters

The agent toolkit (`tckr.agent_toolkit`) wraps each useful function as a read-only tool with a JSON Schema, then exposes the same registry through four adapters:

| Extra | Adapter | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `tckr[agent-mcp]` | `adapters.mcp_stdio` | Universal MCP stdio server (`tckr-mcp` console script). Works with any MCP-compatible client. |
| `tckr[agent-claude]` | `adapters.claude_sdk` | In-process MCP server for the Claude Agent SDK (`build_crypto_mcp_server()`). |
| `tckr[agent-openai]` | `adapters.openai` | OpenAI function-calling shapes (`get_openai_tools()`, also `get_anthropic_tools()`) + `execute_tool(name, args)` dispatcher. |
| `tckr[agent-langchain]` | `adapters.langchain` | LangChain `StructuredTool` instances (`get_langchain_tools()`). |

`tckr[agent]` installs the two most-used adapters (`agent-claude` + `agent-mcp`); `tckr[agent-all]` installs all four.
